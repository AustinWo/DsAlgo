/*

Warshallâ€™s algorithm is used to change adjacency matrix into transitive closure of the graph.

If you can get from vertex A to vertex B, and you can get from B to C, then you can get from A to C.

Derive a 2 steps path from 2 one-step paths.
Adjacency matrix shows all the possible 1-step path.
This algorithm will build on previously discovered multi-edge paths to create paths of arbitary length.
It can find path of more than 2 edges.
